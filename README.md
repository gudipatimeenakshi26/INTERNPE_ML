# InternPe Internship Projects ðŸš€
Welcome to my project repository for the InternPe AI/ML Internship, where I completed two applied machine learning projects:
1. Make a Diabetes Prediction with ML.
2. Car Price Predictor with ML.

**ðŸ”¬ Project 1: Diabetes Prediction**
ðŸ“Œ Objective:
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person has diabetes based on various medical features.
ðŸ“‚ Dataset:
- Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (publicly available)
- Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age
- Target: `Outcome` (0: No diabetes, 1: Diabetes)
ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
ðŸ§  Models Applied:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 ðŸ“Š Evaluation:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-score

**ðŸš— Project 2: Car Price Predictior with ML**
ðŸ“Œ Objective:
To predict the selling price of a used car based on key features using Linear Regression.
ðŸ“‚ Dataset:
- Source: Used Cars Dataset (Indian Market)
- Features: Car Name, Company, Year, Kilometers Driven, Fuel Type
- Target: `Selling Price`
ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
ðŸ§  Techniques:
- Data Cleaning: Removed nulls, handled text data, formatted numbers
- Feature Engineering: One-hot encoding, feature scaling
- Model: Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation: RÂ² Score, Train-Test Split

** Conclusion**
 These projects helped me understand:
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Choosing the right machine learning model for classification and regression
- How to evaluate and improve model performance
